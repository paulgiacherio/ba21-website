            <h3>Design &amp; Development</h3>
            <p>Web Design & Build
The primary service we offer is creating a simple, modern web design to serve your unique needs. All content including image galleries and blog posts will be easily managed by you from an intuitive web-based interface, saving time and expense. Software and tools will be chosen that provide the greatest longevity and flexibility as the site evolves over time. We will create a design that is accessible to a wide user base. This includes users browsing from various platforms and web browsers–known as 'standards-based' and 'responsive' web design.

Brand / Graphic Design
Interested in a new look? We can help.

Custom Blogging
Using a content management system (like Wordpress), we can create a small, easy to follow blog integrated into your website. This will allow for periodic, timely updates and can include diverse content from all over the web; audio, videos, photos, testimonials, news & events are just some content ideas that can be added to the blog.

Consulting
Many times people just need a hand with a particularly sticky design/development issue on their website. Bottom line is: we love to solve problems. Have one? Get in touch.

Social Management
We will work closely with your current services, recommend a few new services, and develop a clear strategy to bring value to your users by offering links to these services. Facebook, Flickr, and Twitter are a few services we recommend. If you want to keep it simple, we'll figure out a way to maximize your efficiency.

Web Hosting Support
We offer web hosting support to our clients. If you would like to inquire about hosting your website, feel free to reach out. For an addition cost we will monitor your site statistics using Google Analytics and handle site-spam, comment-spam and quarterly software updates (for example, Wordpress has been updated 5 times in the last year). This is great for ongoing Wordpress site support. Email us if you're interested in hosting or support.

Personal Training
Available in person or by phone on an hourly basis. We take care to work with your particular computer setup and experience level, and are passionate about giving you the personal support you need to get confident about using your website to the fullest.

Expert Experience
Working full time online since 2003, we have made contributions to the evolution of the internet itself. By harnessing and supporting open-source projects we have fearlessly tried dozens of software tools in various web languages. Our strength is to know the available tools – their ins-and-outs – in order to make a qualified choice about your particular project needs.
