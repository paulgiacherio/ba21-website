                    <h5>Front Door</h5>
                    <p>We constructed a fullscreen background video that depicts industrial material resources use. The video communicates the type of work GreenBlue pursues, and helps convey the gravity of their work.</p>
                    <p>The front door provides an entry point to the primary sections of the site. </p>

                    <p>The previous website provided scant details about GreenBlue's project work. We sought to visually communicate project work and convey project scale through tile size. </p>

                    <p>Blog posts also received visual treatment featuring large header images and a clean, clear layout. </p>
